            <p>
                We followed the testing process by sending each tester a link to the current website and also providing a form 
                regarding the user experience and interaction. The target audience were students who might come 
                across Badekarpadling during their years in university.   
                The form and link was also sendt to the client BadCom so that they could comme with feedback.

            <h2>6. Feedback Summary </h2>
            <p>The feedback on the design of the website was mostly based on the functionality along with few feedbacks about the aesthetic side of the different pages. The effects that were used on the different pages were favored, and there were scaling issues depending on which platform the user tested the website on. </p>
            <ul><h3>Main Page:</h3>
                <li>They liked the main page, although the purple design was not favored, even though they acknowledged that it followed the theme of the logo. </li>
                <li>There was also feedback regarding the issue on the main page having two scroll bars, one for the slides and one for the footer. </li>
                <li>They liked the scroll animation, and thought for the most part that the page was simple and easy to navigate</li>
            </ul>
            <ul><h3>Verv:</h3>
                <li>The pictures of each verv and the blur-effects were favored.</li>
                <li>The text and the textbox on the page was not scaled right for mobile.</li>
                <li>There were issues of wanting the blur-effect to disappear when pressing anywhere on the page.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul><h3>Challenges:</h3>
                <li>Too much space in between the cards and the content.</li>
                <li>The page seemed incomplete, with no background of the theme or pictures. </li>
            </ul>
            <ul><h3>Guide:</h3>
                <li>The theme was not followed. Since the theme page had a darker theme compared to all the other pages, which were bright in color and theme. </li>
                <li>It was hoped that all information would lie on the page, instead of having buttons to navigate through the page.</li>
                <li>The buttons should indicate the steps with keywords instead of numbers</li>
            </ul>
            <ul><h3>Gallery:</h3>
                <li>Scale issues regarding the different pictures.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul><h3>Contact page:</h3>
                <li>Seemed incomplete with the plain white background of the page.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>7. Your Response</h2>
            <p>
                Overall the feedback given by the target testers were constructive, and made us realize that the website had room for improvement. Some of the issues regarding the purple theme would be hard to tackle since our base idea was designing a website based on the purple theme of the logo. Issues regarding the functionality, scaling and the aesthetic side of the website are overall the feedback we took to consideration when improving the design and the interaction of the website.
