            <p>
                Our client, BadCom, a committee under the student organization Smørekoppen, is hosting the tradition “Badekarpadling”. This is a tradition for students in Trondheim where the students build a raft and a cart using bathtubs, while also completing challenges throughout August and September. The raft is used in late September to race to the middle of Nidelva in a capture-the-flag event and the cart is used in a landrace. BadCom would like as many first-year students as possible to compete in this tradition. BadCom already has a website, but we have proposed to replace it with a more modern and higher quality website.

                Purpose and goals
            </h2>
            <p>
                The website's purpose and our goal will be to promote and inform all new students in Trondheim of Badekarpadling, and also promote the BadCom committee. As this is a voluntary position students take, it should be easy and tempting to join the committee. The main goal would be for the website to engage students in Badekarpadling and BadCom. The website should also act as digital documentation of some previous Badekarpadling events. The group will take a mobile-first approach for development, as students might access the website through QR-codes at campus, as well as through social media and get to know about it through word-of-mouth.

                The audience is students in Trondheim, especially first-year students and students that might want to do some voluntary work.

            <p>
                A header containing navbar and footer (containing general contact information and social media) should be constant for every page of the website. The pages not indented will be on the navbar. The indented pages should have links that are extremely visible on its parent page. When the viewport is sufficiently small, the navbar should become a hamburger menu and a small logo should appear at the top right of the screen. The website should maintain its visual integrity on both mobile and desktop.

                    <li>
                        <span class="title">“Home”</span>
                        <br>
                        This is the main page of the website and should be informative about Badekarpadling, while also concise. It should also be possible to find information about volunteering. From home it should also be possible to scroll down to access all the other pages on the navbar, maintaining a mobile friendly environment.

                        On this page everything one would like to know about badekarpadling will exist. There should also be an instantly visible link to the guide and gallery.

                        This page promotes joining Badcom. It should pitch to students on why to join and show how fun it can be to arrange Badekarpadling. The communication of this will be simple and it should be easy to understand how one applies to join Badcom.
